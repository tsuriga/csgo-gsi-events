# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Game State Integration Event Module

This is a module for making catching and parsing [CS:GO Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration "CS:GO Game State Integration") packets less tedious by emitting certain precoded sequences as events. If you wish to see a feature or a missing event implemented, please create an issue on the GitHub page.
